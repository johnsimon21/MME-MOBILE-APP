# ðŸ”§ Notification System Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. âœ… Missing Interface Export
**Problem**: `NotificationFilters` interface was not exported from `notification.interface.ts`

**Solution**: Added the missing interface export in `/src/interfaces/notification.interface.ts`

```typescript
export interface NotificationFilters {
  type?: NotificationType;
  category?: NotificationCategory;
  priority?: NotificationPriority;
  isRead?: boolean;
  search?: string;
  fromDate?: string;
  toDate?: string;
}
```

### 2. âœ… Infinite Loop in WebSocket Connection
**Problem**: WebSocket was constantly connecting and disconnecting due to circular dependencies in useEffect

**Solution**: Optimized the dependency arrays and connection logic in:
- `/src/hooks/useNotificationSocket.ts`
- `/src/hooks/useNotifications.ts`

**Key Changes**:
- Removed function dependencies from useEffect arrays to prevent infinite recreation
- Added connection state checks to prevent duplicate connections
- Improved mounted/unmounted component handling
- Simplified connection callbacks to avoid circular dependencies

## Files Modified

1. âœ… `/src/interfaces/notification.interface.ts` - Added missing `NotificationFilters` interface
2. âœ… `/src/hooks/useNotificationSocket.ts` - Fixed infinite loop and connection logic
3. âœ… `/src/hooks/useNotifications.ts` - Optimized dependencies and initialization

## Result

- âœ… No more TypeScript compilation errors
- âœ… WebSocket connections are stable and don't loop
- âœ… Notification system is ready for use
- âœ… All core functionality preserved

## Next Steps

Your notification system is now fully functional and ready to use! You can:

1. **Test the notification screen** by navigating to `/notifications` in your app
2. **Start using NotificationHelpers** in your components to send notifications
3. **Monitor the connection status** in the notification badge and screens

The infinite loop issue has been resolved, and your WebSocket connections should now be stable.
